Disallow empty source path in the ``binaries`` and ``datas`` tuples
that are returned from the hooks and sanitized in the
``PyInstaller.building.utils.format_binaries_and_datas``. The empty
source path is usually result of an error in the hook's path retrieval
code, and causes implicit collection of the whole current working
directory. This is never the intended behavior, so raise a ``SystemExit``.
